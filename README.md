# UserApp: First App made using Android Studio and Kotlin
  When you run the app the first think you see is the list of users, at first is blank because the dababase
  is empty.
  You can click on the round button on the bottom-right to add a new user with info such as name, surname,
  age, city where he was born and province and click save.
  After you.ve saved you can see the user added.
